The provided Python script serves the purpose of automating the process of importing data from Kaggle into a notebook environment, particularly useful in situations where direct internet access is not available, such as in Kaggle notebooks. Let's dissect and explain the code in detail:

Introduction:
The script starts with an introduction that highlights its purpose and importance, emphasizing the necessity of running the cell to import Kaggle data sources into the notebook's environment.

Importing Libraries:
The script imports essential Python libraries required for various tasks, such as file operations, handling HTTP requests, dealing with compressed files, and managing temporary files.

Constants Definition:
It defines several constants used throughout the script, including the chunk size for file downloads (CHUNK_SIZE), the mapping of dataset names to their corresponding download URLs (DATA_SOURCE_MAPPING), and paths for Kaggle input and working directories (KAGGLE_INPUT_PATH and KAGGLE_WORKING_PATH).

Setting Up Kaggle Environment:
The script proceeds to set up the Kaggle environment by removing any existing Kaggle input directory, recreating it, and creating the working directory if it doesn't exist. It also establishes symbolic links to the input and working directories for easier access.

Downloading and Extracting Data:
The core functionality of the script lies in this section. It iterates over each dataset in the DATA_SOURCE_MAPPING, extracts the dataset name and download URL, downloads the dataset, and then extracts it into the designated directory (destination_path). During the download, it displays progress using a progress bar, ensuring users are informed about the download status. The script handles potential errors gracefully, printing messages if the download or extraction fails.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, the script automates the process of importing Kaggle datasets into the notebook environment, making it convenient for users to access and utilize data for their analysis or machine learning tasks. By encapsulating the necessary steps within a Python script, users can seamlessly integrate Kaggle datasets into their workflow, even in environments with restricted internet access. This script serves as a valuable tool for data scientists, researchers, and enthusiasts leveraging Kaggle's extensive repository of datasets for various projects and experiments.
